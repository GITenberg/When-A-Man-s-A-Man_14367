description: Lawrence Knight, the ubiquitous Eastern wastrel leaves his debutante
  fiancèe, Helen Wakenfield to become a "real man," working as a lowly ranch hand
  in Arizona. The area, however, is suffering from a series of cattle rustlings and
  the newcomer is suspected of being the perpetrator. Knight clears his name in due
  course but loses his fiancèe to another Easterner along the way. Happily, a sweet
  local girl is present to comfort him.
